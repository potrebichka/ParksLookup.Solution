We had a great time, we went all over the city, we found it clean and safe and the people very helpful. I read they appear to take great pride in their jobs and I would agree with that. Theres a lot of bowing and nodding, very polite people we found. The weather was generally very cold, I had to buy some gloves but we did have alot of sunny days and the cherry blossom was in perfect full bloom all over the city.", user_name = "user3", Rating = 3, DestinationId = 6},

It is the only place where the taxi drivers are the best psychologists, or the most maniacal of the insane. The men and women are stunning, it is a place which is constantly moving but at a human pace; it is all based around living life, not moving up a career ladder. The nightlife is amazing as is the day life.", user_name = "user5", Rating = 5, DestinationId = 9},
